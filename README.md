# budgetapp-wordpress
Wordpress version of budgetapp website. 

My second project.

Project was created with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery. It was first time when I used SASS preprocessor for CSS and BEM methodology for my HTML code. After finished front-end part, I connected my website to wordpress platform using PHP. Code you can find in other repository.
